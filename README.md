Overview:
Flite
- Flite is a port of a light-weight voice synthesizer
  of the same name.
- Flite can "read" text files and output the sound
  to either your earphone or a .wav file.
- The ZeroSlackr pack will allow you to read the actual
  text while listening to the synthesized reading.

- http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/flite/

Usage:
- Enable/disable Flite using "Tools > Flite > Enable Flite".
- Place text files in the "Text" folder and use
  "Tools > Flite > Text" to browse them.
- Hold centre on text files to choose "Convert to .wav" option.
- Toggle the "Tools > Flite > Toggle Backlight" setting
  to set backlight on/off.
- Use "Tools > Flite > Kill Flite" to force stop Flite reading.
- Note that Flite is unable to read from text files with spaces
  in their names/path. This is an Flite limitation.
